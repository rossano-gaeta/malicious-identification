######### INPUT #########

-g GRAPHFILE
GRAPHFILE stores the edges of an undirected graph wherein nodes are consecutive integers starting from 0. The format of GRAPHFILE is as follows 
0 1
0 2
... 
...

It means that node 0 and node 1 are connected, nodes 0 and 2 are connected, and so on. It does not matter if an edge appears more than once since multiple arcs are removed.

-m MALICIOUSFILE
MALICIOUSFILE consists of one line that includes a set of malicious nodes separated by space. The format of MALICIOUSFILE is as follows
1 2 4 6 7 8 9 10 ...
It means that "1 2 4 6 7 8 9 10 ..." are malicious nodes.

-s SEED 
SEED sets initial value for the random number generator

######### OUTPUT #########

TP 24 : TN 4015 : FP 0 : FN 0 = 4039

a line describing the number of True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), and False Negatives (FN) as well as the total.

######## USAGE #########

Compile: make

Execute: ./op -g graph.txt -m malicious.txt -s 123
